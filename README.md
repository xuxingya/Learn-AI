# Learn-AI
It's a library of how I learn AI technology

## Courses resource of AI

   * [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) (By Michael Nielsen)

   It is an easy-to-understand introduction of deep leanrning, including Algebra, figures and code explanation of neural neworks.

   * [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (By Stanford Andrew Ng)

   A good course to learn machine from zero. Learning another couse <Deep Learning>  will be easier after finishing this one.
  
   * [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) (By deeplearning.ai Andrew Ng et al.)
  
   Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. Including <Neural Networks and Deep Learning>, <Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization>, <Structuring Machine Learning Projects>, <Convolutional Neural Networks>, <Sequence Models>.
  
   * [Deep Learning](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud730)(By Google)
   
Google's deep learning course on Udacity

   * [A guide to convolution arithmetic for deep learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07285v1.pdf)(By Vincent Dumoulin1 and Francesco Visin)
 
This guide’s objective is:
1. Explain the relationship between convolutional layers and transposed convolutional layers.
2. Provideanintuitiveunderstandingoftherelationshipbetweeninputshape, kernel shape, zero padding, strides and output shape in convolutional, pooling and transposed convolutional layers.
