## Courses resource of AI

  # * [ Neural Networks and Deep Learning ](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) (By Michael Nielsen)

  It is an easy-to-understand introduction of deep leanrning, including Algebra, figures and code explanation of neural neworks.

  # * [ Machine Learning ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (By Stanford Andrew Ng)

  A good course to learn machine from zero. Learning another couse <Deep Learning>  will be easier after finishing this one.
  
  # * [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) (By deeplearning.ai Andrew Ng et al.)
  
  Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. Including <Neural Networks and Deep Learning>, <Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization>, <Structuring Machine Learning Projects>, <Convolutional Neural Networks>, <Sequence Models>.
  
  # * [ Deep Learning ] (https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud730) (By Google)
Google's deep learning course on Udacity. I am learning this now, exciting!

 # * [ A guide to convolution arithmetic for deep learning ] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07285v1.pdf) (By Vincent Dumoulin1 and Francesco Visin)
 
This guide’s objective is twofold:
1. Explain the relationship between convolutional layers and transposed con- volutional layers.
2. Provideanintuitiveunderstandingoftherelationshipbetweeninputshape, kernel shape, zero padding, strides and output shape in convolutional, pooling and transposed convolutional layers.
